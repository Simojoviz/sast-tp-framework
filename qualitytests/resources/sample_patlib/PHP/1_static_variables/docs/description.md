This pattern targets `static` variables. When a function terminates, its local variables are destroyed. When we run that function again, new local variables will be allocated. If we want to keep one of those variables alive, we can use the `static` keyword. Static variables may be challenging for SAST tools: is a SAST tool considering a static variable used in a function as alive?
